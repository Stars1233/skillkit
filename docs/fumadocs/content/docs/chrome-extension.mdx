# Chrome Extension

Save any webpage as a SKILL.md directly from your browser. No server needed.

## Install

1. Download the extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/rohitg00/skillkit/releases)
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `packages/extension/dist/` folder

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitg00/skillkit.git
cd skillkit
pnpm install && pnpm --filter @skillkit/extension build
```

Then load `packages/extension/dist/` as an unpacked extension.

## Usage

### Popup

1. Navigate to any webpage
2. Click the SkillKit extension icon
3. Optionally enter a custom skill name
4. Click **Save as Skill**

The extension extracts the page content as markdown, generates a SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter and auto-detected tags, and downloads it to your `Downloads/skillkit-skills/` folder.

### Context Menu

Right-click on any page:

- **Save page as Skill** — saves the entire page
- **Save selection as Skill** — saves only the selected text

### Making Skills Available to Agents

After downloading, install the skill so all agents can use it:

```bash
skillkit install ~/Downloads/skillkit-skills/my-skill
```

Or copy directly:

```bash
cp -r ~/Downloads/skillkit-skills/my-skill ~/.skillkit/skills/
skillkit sync
```

## How It Works

The extension runs entirely in the browser:

1. **Content script** extracts page content using [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) to convert HTML to clean markdown. It targets `<article>`, `<main>`, or `<body>` and strips scripts, nav, footer, and iframes.

2. **Background service worker** generates the SKILL.md:
   - Slugifies the page title into a skill name
   - Builds YAML frontmatter (name, description, source URL, timestamp)
   - Auto-detects tags from 40+ tech keywords (react, typescript, docker, kubernetes, etc.)
   - Downloads via `chrome.downloads` API

3. **No server required** — the `POST /save` API endpoint exists for CLI users (`skillkit save`), but the extension works independently.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `contextMenus` | Right-click "Save as Skill" menu items |
| `activeTab` | Access current page URL and title |
| `storage` | Persist extension preferences |
| `downloads` | Save SKILL.md files to disk |

No `host_permissions` needed. The extension never sends data to any server.

## Generated SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: react-performance-tips
description: Optimizing React rendering with memo and useMemo
tags:
  - react
  - javascript
  - testing
metadata:

## Building from Source

The extension uses tsup to bundle TypeScript into IIFE format for browser compatibility:

```bash
pnpm --filter @skillkit/extension build
```

Output goes to `packages/extension/dist/` with:
- `background.global.js` — Service worker (5KB)
- `content.global.js` — Content script with Turndown (23KB)
- `popup.global.js` — Popup UI logic (3KB)
- `popup.html` + `popup.css` — Monochromatic UI
- `manifest.json` — Chrome Manifest V3
- `icons/` — 16/48/128px PNG icons
